<p>
 As Mackenzie Graham prepares to enter the final semester of college, she knows what lies ahead: Finding a job that will put her political science degree to work for her, and paying back the money she borrowed to pay for that degree.
</p>
<p>
 The 21-year-old University of Pittsburgh student from York admits the four years of federal student loan debt she has accumulated is a concern.</p>


  <p>
     “It’ll be obviously a burden to have to start paying it back after school along with all the other expenses like moving out and getting my own place,” she said.</p>


<p>
  But this past fall, she got word that her school has selected her for a new program it is launching called Panthers <i>Forward</i> that will help to alleviate some of her debt load.</p>

<p>
 It’s a novel pay-it-forward approach that’s caught the attention of national financial aid experts.</p>

<p>
  Here’s how it works:</p>

<p>
  Shortly after the chosen students graduate, the program will apply $5,000 to their federal loan balance. Students owing less than $5,000 will have their entire loan balance will be paid off. The money to lower the loan balances comes from the university Chancellor Patrick Gallagher’s discretionary funds, a university official said.</p>

<p>
 In exchange, the students agree to make monthly contributions in any amount they choose. All those contributions go directly back into the program to lower the debt load of future participants.</p>

 <p>
 While this program is no panacea to the looming student debt crisis — Pennsylvania students, combined, owe $55 billion in federal loan debt — it strikes National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators President Justin Draeger as a unique approach to promote good feelings alumni have toward their school and encourage them to give back to help others.</p>

 <p>
 “It’ll serve as a model, at least at a local level, to see is this sort of message resonating and one, creating sustainable alumni and two, whether it’s actually going to make a noticeable dent in student loan debt,” he said. “My hunch is that the people graduating from this school, that will resonate with them, but we’ll see.”</p>

 <p>
 Pennsylvania’s average student debt load of $36,193 is the highest in the nation, according to a  <a href="https://lendedu.com/blog/average-student-loan-debt-statistics#PA"><font color="blue">LendEDU study</font></a>. Two out of three Pennsylvania students graduate college with at least some debt, according to that study.</p>
 <p>
 Nationally, <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2018/12/student-debt-tops-146-trillion-more-than-doubling-since-2009-report.html"><font color="blue">student debt has reached $1.465 trillion</font></a>, more than double what it was in 2009, according to an analysis by Bloomberg.</p>
 <p>
 Graham and her friends are all too aware of the burden of that debt.</p>
 <p>
 “We’re not excited when we graduate to have to start paying it back,” Graham said. “My one friend make jokes. She’s like ‘I can’t wait to go to graduate school to defer them a few years.’ We try to make it funny but it’s not funny.”</p>
 <p>
 So that’s why Graham didn’t ignore the email she and other students graduating in 2019 received from Gallagher announcing the Panthers <i>Forward</i> program.</p>
 <p>
 “I immediately went to it and looked at it and thought, ‘Wow, I definitely need to apply for this,” she said. “I did and I didn’t think I was actually going to get it.”</p>
 <p>
 When she got word that she was one of 150 students chosen for the inaugural class of program participants, Graham said she was so excited that she had to call her family to share the good news.</p>
 <p>
The $5,000 credit that Graham and others in this first class of Panthers <i>Forward</i> participants – two-thirds of whom are from Pennsylvania – will receive will lower their loan debt by 20 percent, on average, said Pitt spokesman Kevin Zwick.</p>
 <p>
 “We feel it’s incumbent on us to address the growing issue of student debt facing students across the country. Setting our students on a path to success right after they graduate and alleviating some of their debt burden is an important part of that,” Zwick said.</p>
 <p>
 “The pay-it-forward model enabling students moving through the program to help future students who will follow their path is both unique and something we feel Pitt students, with their strong affinity for their school, will be enthusiastic about doing it.”</p>
 <p>
 Graham’s fondness for her university runs deep.</p>
 <p>
 The 2015 York Suburban High School graduate chose Pitt over other Pennsylvania colleges because “there was a lot of cool opportunities at the school since it was in a city. So I really liked that.”</p>
 <p>
Since then, she has come to appreciate the help she received from her adviser to decide on a major. She is grateful for the opportunity she had to participate in the university’s study-abroad program. Graham also liked how the school helped her connect with the internships she has had with a Pittsburgh City Council member and a non-profit.</p>
<p>
This spring, she looks forward to connecting with Pitt alumni who earned political science degrees in hopes of gaining some insight from these mentors about how to find a meaningful job in her field after graduation.</p>
<p>
“Hopefully, I can do that in the future for the future Pitt students,” she said, “and also the same for giving money back to the [Panthers <i>Forward</i>] program for future Pitt students to keep the program going.”</p>
