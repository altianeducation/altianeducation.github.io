 <p class="texttwo"> In the tumult of 1968, a group of students gathered to form what would become the Black Action Society. The mission? To advocate for the concerns, needs and interests of Black students at the University of Pittsburgh and members of the local African American community. <br>

  The group grew. And on Jan. 16, 1969, 48 students staged a sit-in in the eighth-floor computer center in the Cathedral of Learning, to insist that four specific demands be met to improve Black life on campus<br>

  For Homecoming this October, the African American Alumni Council (AAAC) celebrates those students’ activism and the progress it ushered in with “50 Years of Pride, Progress and Partnership at the University of Pittsburgh,” a special lineup of programming to launch a year of celebrations honoring the people who catalyzed change on campus in 1968-69 — and recognizing those today who work to further that legacy.<br>
  Former AAAC president Linda Wharton-Boyd (A&S ’75, ’79), who is organizing this year’s events, said “there’s something on this program for everyone. It crescendos into the major 2019 event which commemorates the takeover of the computer center, which was the catalyst of change that we see today.”<br>
